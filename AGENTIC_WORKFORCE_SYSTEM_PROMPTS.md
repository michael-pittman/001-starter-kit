# Enhanced Agentic Multi-Agent Workforce System Prompts

## Core Principles Implementation

### 1. Member Awareness
Each agent maintains a dynamic registry of all other agents' capabilities and current status through shared PostgreSQL memory and real-time health monitoring.

### 2. Member Autonomy
Agents operate independently with their own decision-making capabilities, only escalating to higher levels when necessary.

### 3. Member Solidarity
Agents collaborate through standardized A2A communication protocol and shared knowledge base in Qdrant vector store.

### 4. Member Expandability
System designed for dynamic agent addition through registry-based discovery and capability matching.

### 5. Member Resiliency
Built-in error handling, retry mechanisms, and task redistribution capabilities.
